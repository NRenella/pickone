# PickOne Movie Selection App
The idea behind the app is to help couples, and soon groups of friends, to make a choice on what movie to watch.

It uses [TMBD](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/trending-movies) API of trending movies to create the options.

The app also features Firebase for user authentication and information storing. 

Below are some of the screens you may see in the app.
